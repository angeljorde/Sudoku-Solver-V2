SUDOKU SOLVER V2

This program was created by Angel Jorde Sosa in December 2023. 

It is the second version of another solver I programmed in August 2023. 

In the first version I based the program on filling the empty cells with the whole range of values (123456789) and eliminating each of these values in each iteration until I got a matrix with a value in each cell. This worked, but it was not very efficient. 

In this second version I have based the program on checking which cells are empty and trying values until I find the right ones. This programme is more efficient and fast. Also it requires less code lines and the code is more elegant.

It was programmed with the aim of practising programming logic in JavaScript. For this reason, this version also has no interface.

To use this code and to solve Sudokus you must manually change the board constant and check the result in the console.
